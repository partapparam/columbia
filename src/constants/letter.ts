        <p>I am writing to express my strong support for the 881 Abbot
Kinney mixed-use project, a significant investment that will help meet the
unmet demand for more hospitality services to Venice visitors.<br><br>
Venice is a diverse community whose eclectic nature continues to play a
defining role in America’s contemporary cultural movement. Expanding Venice’s
hospitality offering will satisfy a key need in our community, boost local
business, and stimulate economic activity – all while contributing to Venice’s
unique character and charm that make it a special place to live and visit in
Southern California.<br><br>
The city-approved and community-supported project will be compatible with
surrounding uses and provide 43 guest rooms and ground-floor retail, designed
to complement the style of Abbot Kinney Boulevard. Its mass, scale and design
conforms to the Venice Coastal Zone Specific Plan and is the same as the
originally approved 2007 project. The project, consistent with its original
2007 approval, showcases architectural revisions that introduce more openness
and visual appeal, a nod to Venice’s artistic spirit. The structure will be an
appealing, walkable space that respects and complements the existing
neighborhood. The project is a responsible development that has been thoroughly
reviewed and supported by the City, the Venice Neighborhood Council, adjacent
property owners and community leaders and has adhered to City requirements
throughout the planning and construction process.<br><br>
I look forward to seeing the project completed and encourage the City to 
support it.
        </p>`
